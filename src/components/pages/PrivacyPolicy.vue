                        <p><span>Interest-based advertising has now become commonplace on the Internet. It is

                                        searches you
                                        conduct. We can then infer your interests and place ads, and offer you deals that are

                                        needs. Our goal with interest-based advertising is to show advertisements to people who

                                        browser with a
                                        recognized cookie has accessed a page or a specific part of a page on our platform,
                                        depending on the
                                        location of the web beacon on the platform. A web beacon on our purchase confirmation
                                        page, for example,
                                        will record that a browser with a recognized cookie accessed that page, implying that
                                        the browser was
                                        used to purchase a product. The web beacon, on the other hand, does not tell us that you

                                        (via PII) purchased any product because the cookie only identifies the browser and not
